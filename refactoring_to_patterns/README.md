# Refactoring to Patterns - Code Examples

This collection contains practical code examples demonstrating key refactoring patterns from Joshua Kerievsky's "Refactoring to Patterns" book. Each pattern includes a "before" and "after" version to clearly show the transformation and benefits of applying the pattern.

These examples are written in Java and designed to be educational, focusing on clarity and practical application of each refactoring pattern. Each refactoring addresses real problems in code design: reducing complexity, improving clarity, and making code easier to change and extend.
